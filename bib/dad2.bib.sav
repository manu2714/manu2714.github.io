Using a simulation technique developed by Studer 2012, we investigate the sensitivity, relative to OM, of several variants of this metric to variations in order, timing and duration of states. The results show that the behavior of the metric is as intended. Furthermore, we use family formation data from the Swiss Household Panel to compare a few variants of the new metric to OM. The new metrics have been implemented in the freely available TraMineR-package.},
